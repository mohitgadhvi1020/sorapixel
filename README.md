# SoraPixel — AI Product Photography for Kitchenware

Transform raw product photos into studio-quality images in seconds.

## How it works

1. **Upload** a raw product photo (even a phone picture)
2. **Pick a style** — kitchen counter, marble surface, lifestyle scene, etc.
3. **AI generates** a professional studio scene around your product
4. **Download** a marketplace-ready pack: hero shot, alternate angle, close-up, and optional info images

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example env file and add your API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your API key.

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
