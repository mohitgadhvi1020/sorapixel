Guidelines
1. About Stylika
Stylika is an Indian fashion jewelry brand with a 30-year manufacturing
legacy, launching its Shopify e-commerce store at www.stylika.com.
What we sell: Fashion jewellery — plated, coated, alloy-based pieces. NOT
precious metals. This distinction is legally and commercially critical.
Who we sell to: Urban Indian women, 22–45, who mix ethnic and western
wardrobes. They buy jewelry for self-reward, micro-occasions (kitty parties,
office events, pre-wedding shoots), and gifting. They're Instagram-native,
style-conscious, and prefer variety over "investment pieces."
Brand positioning: Bridges ethnic and western aesthetics. Not a new-age
startup — established manufacturing trust. Think Lovisa's clean aesthetic, but
for the Indian context.
Launch scope: Western jewellery first. Ethnic jewellery added later.
2. Brand Voice Rules
The AI must internalize these — they define what "sounds like Stylika":
Tone: Confident, modern, accessible. Like a stylish friend who knows her
jewellery — not a salesperson, not a poet.
DO:
Write in clear, direct sentences
Focus on how the piece looks, feels, and what to wear it with
Use active voice
Mention versatility (ethnic + western pairing potential)
Keep it warm but not gushy
DON'T:
Use flowery/aspirational language ("exquisite radiance," "timeless
elegance," "celestial beauty")
Over-promise ("waterproof," "sterile jewelry," "never fades," "lasts
forever")
Use precious metal terms without qualifiers (see Material Language
section)
Sound generic or template-y
Add filler ("This beautiful piece is perfect for those who…")
Use words like "luxurious," "opulent," "dazzling," "mesmerizing"
3. CRITICAL: Material Language Rules
This is a legal and trust requirement. Non-negotiable.
Fashion jewellery is plated/coated — it is NOT solid gold, silver, or platinum.
The content must never imply otherwise.
❌ NEVER Write ✅ ALWAYS Write
Gold earrings Gold-tone earrings
Silver ring Silver-tone ring
Gold necklace Gold-plated brass necklace
Rose gold bracelet Rose-gold-tone bracelet
Platinum finish Rhodium-plated finish
Diamond studs CZ Diamond studs
Pearl necklace Pearl / Pearl necklace
Emerald drops Green stone drops
Acceptable material descriptions for bullet points:
"Material: Brass with gold plating"
"Material: Alloy with rhodium finish"
"Material: Brass with rose-gold-tone plating"
"Stones: Cubic Zirconia (CZ)"
"Stones: Faux pearls"
"Stones: Glass crystals"
Rule of thumb: If a customer could misunderstand the piece as containing
precious metals or real gemstones, the language is wrong.
4. Product Taxonomy
The system must assign products to the correct category, collection, and
occasion. Here is the full taxonomy:
4a. Categories (by product type + subcategory)
Necklaces: Choker Necklaces, Pendant Necklaces, Statement Necklaces,
Lariat Necklaces, Pendant Set Necklaces, Charm Necklaces, Pearl
Necklaces
Earrings: Hoops, Drops/Danglers, Studs, Huggies, Statement Earrings, Clip-
on, Pearl Earrings, Ear Cuffs
Rings: Statement Rings, Minimal Rings, Pearl Rings, Diamond (CZ) Rings,
Stackable Rings
Wristwear: Kadas, Bracelets, Chain, Cuffs, Tennis, Charm, Statement,
Beaded
4b. Collections (applies to ALL product types)
Collection What It Means
Minimal Clean lines, understated, everyday pieces
Bold Chunky, oversized, attention-grabbing
Glam Sparkle-forward, CZ-heavy, party-ready
Romance Soft, feminine, florals, pearls, delicate
4c. Occasions (applies to ALL product types)
Occasion Context
Everyday Wear Office, casual outings, daily use
Occasion Context
Festive Wear Office Wear Party Wear Diwali, Navratri, Eid, Pongal, Holi
Subtle, professional, not distracting
Cocktails, birthdays, night out
Wedding Wear Bridal, bridesmaid, mehendi, sangeet
4d. Category Assignment Logic
The AI should assign:
1. One primary category (e.g., "Earrings > Hoops")
2. One collection (e.g., "Minimal")
3. One or two occasions (e.g., "Everyday Wear, Office Wear")
4. Style tag: "Western" or "Ethnic" (launch phase = Western only, but
system should support both)
5. Output Specification
For each product image, the system must generate ALL of the following:
5a. Product Title
Length: 50–65 characters (Shopify truncates longer titles in search
results)
Format: `[Descriptive Name] [Key Detail]| Stylika
Front-load the most searchable/descriptive terms
Natural language — no pipes or separators mid-title
Always end with | Stylika
Good examples:
CZ Hoop Earrings with Pearl Drop | Stylika
Stackable Minimal Band Ring Set of 3 | Stylika
Chunky Chain Link Bracelet Gold-Tone | Stylika
Crystal Drop Statement Earrings | Stylika
Bad examples:
Beautiful Golden Earrings | Stylika
(vague, "golden" is
misleading)
CZ | Hoop | Pearl | Earring | Stylika
(fragmented, unreadable)
Earrings (no detail)
The Most Gorgeous Pearl Drop Earrings You'll Ever Own |
Stylika
(too long, too salesy)
Gold-Tone CZ Hoop Earrings with Pearl Drop | Stylika(no
tones/colours in the description)
5b. Product Description (HTML-ready)
Structure — two paragraphs + bullet list:
Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences): What the piece IS + its defining visual feature.
If the piece has design inspiration (Kundan work, Art Deco geometry, etc.),
weave it in naturally here. Do not create a separate "story" section.
Paragraph 2 (2-3 sentences): How to WEAR it — versatility, pairing
suggestions, occasion fit. This is where you sell the styling potential.
Bullet List (product specs):
• Material: [Base metal] with [plating type]
• Stones: [Stone types, if any]
• Collection: [Minimal / Bold / Glam / Romance]
• Style: [Western / Ethnic]
• Closure: [Post-back / Lobster clasp / Adjustable / etc.] (if
relevant)
Include a "Care" bullet ONLY for pieces that genuinely need it (heavy
plating, delicate stones). Don't add generic care instructions to every product.
Total word count: 100–140 words. Can extend to 160 ONLY for genuinely
complex multi-element pieces. Simpler pieces (studs, minimal rings) should
be closer to 100.
HTML formatting:
Wrap paragraphs in
<p>
tags
Use
<ul><li>
for bullet specs
No
<h1>
or
<h2>
inside descriptions (Shopify handles headings)
No inline styles
Example output:
<p>Clean geometric lines meet subtle sparkle in these gold-
tone hoop earrings. A single row of CZ stones traces the outer
edge, adding just enough light without overwhelming the
design.</p>
<p>Sized to sit close to the ear, they work equally well with
a crisp white shirt at work or a kurta set for weekend
brunches. Light enough for all-day wear.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<li>Material: Brass with gold plating</li>
<li>Stones: Cubic Zirconia (CZ)</li>
<li>Collection: Minimal</li>
<li>Style: Western</li>
<li>Closure: Hinged post</li>
5c. Meta Description
Length: 140–155 characters (hard limit — Google truncates beyond this)
Format: Action-oriented, includes product type + one key differentiator +
brand name
Must include a natural keyword for SEO
No quotes, no special characters
Good examples:
Shop gold-tone CZ hoop earrings at Stylika. Lightweight,
everyday sparkle designed for the modern Indian woman.
(142
chars)
Stackable minimal rings in gold-tone finish. Mix, match, and
layer your way. Shop Stylika fashion jewellery. (135 chars)
Bad examples:
Buy earrings online at Stylika. Best earrings in India. Gold
earrings for women. (keyword-stuffed, "gold" without qualifier)
These beautiful earrings are perfect for every occasion and
will make you feel confident and stylish. (generic, no product
detail)
5d. Alt Text (for images)
Length: Under 125 characters
Descriptive, not salesy
Include: product type, material/finish, key visual element
No brand name needed (it's on the page)
Format: [Finish] [product type] with [key visual detail]
Examples:
Gold-tone hoop earrings with single row of CZ stones
Chunky silver-tone chain bracelet with toggle clasp
Minimal stackable ring set in rose-gold-tone finish
5e. Structured Attributes (for Shopify tags/filters)
Output as a clean key-value block:
Material: Brass + Gold Plating
Stone: CZ
Color: Gold
Collection: Minimal
Occasion: Everyday, Office
Style: Western
Product Type: Earrings > Hoops
These map directly to Shopify's filter/tag system.
6. Input Specification
Required Input
Product image(s): At minimum one clear product photo
Product type: Necklaces / Earrings / Rings / Wristwear
Optional Input (AI should infer from image if missing)
Stone type (CZ, Mother-of-Pearl, Multi-stone, None)
Plating/finish (gold-tone, silver-tone, rose-gold-tone, rhodium)
Collection (Minimal, Bold, Glam, Romance)
Style (Western / Ethnic)
Any special notes (e.g., "this is part of a set," "adjustable sizing")
When data is missing: The AI should infer from the image and state its
assumption. Use "[TBD]" for attributes it genuinely cannot determine.
7. Edge Cases & Conditional Logic
Simple/Minimal pieces (studs, thin bands, basic chains)
Skip cultural/design inspiration language
Focus on versatility and wearability
Target 100–110 words
Don't over-describe — if it's a simple gold-tone stud, say so plainly
Complex/Ornate pieces (statement necklaces, multi-
stone sets)
Include brief design reference in Paragraph 1 (Kundan work, Art Deco,
Victorian)
Detail craftsmanship specifics
Can extend to 150–160 words
More pairing/occasion suggestions in Paragraph 2
Sets (necklace + earring sets, stackable ring sets)
Title should mention "Set" clearly
Description should note what's included
Alt text: describe the complete set
Products with multiple finishes/variants
Generate base content once
Note variant in title and attributes (e.g., "Available in Gold-Tone and Silver-
Tone")
Pieces that cross Ethnic/Western boundary
Tag as the PRIMARY style, note crossover in description
Example: A Kundan-inspired piece with modern silhouette → Ethnic
primary, mention western pairing
8. SEO & AI Discoverability Guidelines
For Search Engines (Google)
Title: Front-load primary keywords (product type first, then details)
Meta description: Include one natural long-tail keyword
Description: Use the product type name at least once naturally
Alt text: Descriptive and specific
Shopify meta title format: [Product Name] | Stylika
For AI Shopping Assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini,
Perplexity)
AI shopping assistants parse structured product data. The output should be
machine-readable:
Keep bullet specs consistent in format across all products
Use standardized attribute names (always "Material:" not sometimes
"Made of:")
Include occasion context (AI assistants answer queries like "earrings for
office wear")
Mention style pairing (AI assistants answer "what jewelry goes with a
blazer")
Keywords to Naturally Include (where relevant)
Fashion jewellery, Indian jewelry online, gold-tone, [product type], [occasion]
jewelry, Stylika
Never keyword-stuff. If a keyword doesn't fit naturally, skip it.
9. Quality Validation Checklist
Before the output is considered final, it must pass ALL of these:
No use of "gold," "silver," "platinum," "diamond," "pearl" without proper
qualifiers
Title is 50–65 characters and ends with | Stylika
Meta description is 140–155 characters
Description is 100–160 words (based on complexity)
Alt text is under 125 characters
No flowery/aspirational language
No over-promises (waterproof, lifetime, never tarnish)
Category + Collection + Occasion assigned
HTML formatting is clean (p tags, ul/li, no inline styles)
Stone/material info is consistent between description bullets and attributes
No follow-up questions, conversational fluff, or "Would you like…" endings
